# Mobile Navigation Fix

## Issue
The hamburger menu in the mobile navigation was not working correctly. When clicking on the hamburger icon, the menu was not opening.

## Root Cause
The issue was that the JavaScript file responsible for the mobile navigation functionality (`mobile-nav.js`) was not being included in the HTML files.

## Solution
We've implemented several solutions to fix this issue:

1. **Modified the mobile-nav.js file**: Added a self-executing function that injects the mobile navigation code into the page when the file is loaded.

2. **Created a nav-loader.js file**: This script automatically loads the mobile-nav.js file when included in an HTML file.

3. **Created a demo.html file**: This file demonstrates how to use the nav-loader.js file to add mobile navigation functionality to a website.

## How to Fix the Issue

### Option 1: Add the nav-loader.js script to your HTML files
Add the following script tag to your HTML files, just before the closing body tag:

```html
<script src="nav-loader.js"></script>
```

### Option 2: Add the mobile-nav.js script directly to your HTML files
Add the following script tag to your HTML files, just before the closing body tag:

```html
<script src="mobile-nav.js"></script>
```

### Option 3: Use the code from custom-scripts.js
The `custom-scripts.js` file already contains the mobile navigation code. If you're already including this file in your HTML, you don't need to add any additional scripts.

## Testing
To test the fix, open the demo.html file in a browser and click on the hamburger icon. The mobile navigation menu should open and close correctly.

## Files Created/Modified
- `mobile-nav.js`: Modified to include a self-executing function that injects the mobile navigation code into the page.
- `nav-loader.js`: Created to automatically load the mobile-nav.js file.
- `auto-loader.html`: Created to provide instructions on how to include the script.
- `demo.html`: Created to demonstrate how to use the nav-loader.js file.
- `README.md`: Created to document the issue and solution.

## Note
The CSS for the mobile navigation is already included in the `styles.css` file. The issue was only with the JavaScript functionality.
