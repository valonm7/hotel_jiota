# Instructions for Implementing the Changes

## 1. Room Availability Search Page
- The new availability.html page has been created and is ready to use.

## 2. Linking the Calendar Icon to the Availability Page
There are two ways to implement this change:

### Option 1: Using the custom JavaScript file
1. Add the following script tag just before the closing </body> tag in index.html:
```html
<script src="custom-scripts.js"></script>
```
This script will automatically make the calendar icon clickable and link it to availability.html.

### Option 2: Directly modifying the HTML (recommended)
1. Find the date-badge div in index.html (around line 131):
```html
<div class="date-badge">
  <span class="date-text">March 15, 2024</span>
  <div class="icon-wrapper">
    <i class="fas fa-calendar-alt"></i>
  </div>
</div>
```

2. Replace it with an anchor tag:
```html
<a href="availability.html" class="date-badge">
  <span class="date-text">March 15, 2024</span>
  <div class="icon-wrapper">
    <i class="fas fa-calendar-alt"></i>
  </div>
</a>
```

## 3. Improved Picture Display in rooms.html
- The CSS for room images in rooms.html has been updated to handle different aspect ratios better.
- Images now use object-fit: contain instead of cover, which preserves the aspect ratio.
- A light background color has been added to fill any empty space.

## 4. Enhanced Rooms Section in index.html
There are two ways to implement this change:

### Option 1: Using the custom JavaScript file
1. Add the following script tag just before the closing </body> tag in index.html:
```html
<script src="custom-scripts.js"></script>
```
This script will automatically apply the styling to make the rooms section fill the entire width and make the cards bigger.

### Option 2: Using the custom CSS file
1. Add the following link tag in the head section of index.html, after the styles.css link:
```html
<link rel="stylesheet" href="custom-styles.css">
```
The custom-styles.css file includes all the necessary styles to:
- Make the rooms section fill the entire width
- Make the room cards bigger
- Enhance the visual appearance of the cards

## Reference Files
- index-modified.html: A simplified version of index.html with all the necessary changes applied
- custom-styles.css: CSS file with styles for the rooms section
- custom-scripts.js: JavaScript file that applies the styling dynamically

## How to Test
1. Open index.html in a browser
2. Click on the calendar icon in the header - it should navigate to the availability.html page
3. Check that the rooms section in index.html fills the entire width and has bigger cards
4. Open rooms.html and verify that the images display correctly with different aspect ratios
